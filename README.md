# Agricultural-Productivity-in-Ghana
Details
Goal: The objective is to ascertain whether observed production shortfalls in Ghana are solely due to farmer Inefficiency, technology gaps, or some combination of the two.

The project compose of a series of articles using samples of farmers drawn from multiple cross-sectional population-based surveys fielded throughout Ghana from 1987 to 2017, to estimate meta-stochastic-frontier models that account for heterogeneity in technology and technical inefficiency. The articles subsequently ascertains the farmer and institutional factors that either enhance or attenuate technical inefficiency and adoption of superior technology. Additionally, reference maps that show the spatial distribution of regional-level crop-specific technical inefficiency, technology, and technical inefficiency due to technology gap are created to inform policies.

By putting the sources of crop production shortfalls in Ghana on a solid empirical footing, it helps assess its validity, while informing the policy dialogue where production needs to be increased amidst limited new technologies. Specifically, the output from these studies provides valuable information on how the productivity of crop farmers could be increased by implementing the correct policies based on main source of production shortfalls.
